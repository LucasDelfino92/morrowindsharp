<details>
  <summary>v2.7.2.3 (August 22th)</summary>

This update is compatible with an existing playthrough.

- üÜï [**Lucky Loot**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49839?tab=files) (Gameplay)
- üÜï [**N'wah Shooter - Marksman Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49657?tab=files) (Overhauls)
- üÜï [**Smarter Soultrap**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49121?tab=files) (Overhauls)

- üö´ [**WIP Detailed Correct UV Rocks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44321?tab=files) (Visuals): sadly the mesh changes have been done in ways less-than-ideal, with the shape of the meshes drastically differing at times from the vanilla meshes, leading to clipping and other issues. Moreover, the UV maps feature some stretching, with the original mod did its best to correct.
- üö´ [**Pincushion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46862?tab=files) (Visuals): removed in favour of **N'wah Shooter - Marksman Overhaul**.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Character Sound Overhaul** (Audio): added editing instructions to remove an unnecessary debug log which convoluted the MWSE.log.

# DISCLAIMER

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in the [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md#morrowind-setup) page. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Morrowind and the recommended tools.

# TOOLS

Because mods can conflict with one another, or have bugs/unintended changes themselves, we will be installing a number of tools to help us troubleshoot and get rid of these issues. Detailed instructions on how to use these tools can be found in the [**Tools**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tools) guide, however, you will be redirected to them when the time is right to use them.

## TES3View, TES3Merge, TESAME

[**TES3View**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWixc_jahvJZb0AKBfHv8Gi4ozDSNrie/view?usp=sharing)  
Used to see the structure of mods and detect conflicts.
- Extract the contents of the file in **Morrowind Mods\TES3View**. 

> The version I'm hosting can be downloaded from [**xEdit's Discord**](https://discordapp.com/invite/5t8RnNQ) under **xedit-builds**, called **xEdit_4.1.3a_EXTREMELY_EXPERIMENTAL.7z**. Both the folder and the .exe have been renamed to TES3View in order for the tool to work for Morrowind.

[**TES3Merge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46870?tab=files)  
Used to solve conflicts by merging conflicting records into a separate plugin, **Merged Objects.esp**.
- Extract the contents of the file in **Morrowind Mods\TES3Merge**.

[**TESAME**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-95-15443)  
Used to clean plugins and solve conflicts by manually deleting conflicting or dirty records (unintended changes by the mod's author).
- Extract the contents of the file in **Morrowind Mods\TESAME**.

### Registering tools in Mod Organizer 2

For our modding tools to work in Mod Organizer 2, we need to register and configure them. You will have to repeat these steps for each of the three tools installed above.

- Click the **Modify Executables** ![Executables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_Executables.png) button.
- Click the **Add an executable** ![AddExe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_Add_File.png) button and select *Add from file...*.
- Navigate to the folder of the tool you want to install (each found inside **C:\Games\Morrowind Mods**) and double click its .exe file.
- In the **Start In** field, select your Morrowind **Root** folder (**C:\Games\Morrowind**).
- Click **Apply**, and repeat the process for the remaining tools.

## Wrye Mash

[**Wrye Mash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439?tab=files)  
Wrye Mash is a mod manager and a tool used to repair and update saves, update the masters of mods, and to run tes3cmd in order to clean plugins and generate a **multipatch**.
- Download and run the **Wrye Mash 2019 x64 - Installer** main file.
- When prompted to choose an install location, choose your Morrowind **Root** folder (**C:\Games\Morrowind**).
- When installation has finished, click **Finish** to launch the **Wrye Mash 2019 Configuration Wizard**.
- Eventually the installation wizard will ask you to fill the following entries:
   - **Morrowind directory**: select your Morrowind **Root** folder (**C:\Games\Morrowind**). A message should appear under the directory saying that morrowind.ini and "Data files" folder were found.
   - **Mods Installers directory**: select your Morrowind mods folder (**C:\Games\Morrowind Mods**).
- Click **Next** and then click **Finish**.
- Wrye Mash x64 will now launch. Close the program.

> The **Mods Installers directory** is redundant to us, as we use Mod Organizer 2 to install our mods. However, it is a required step to install Wrye Mash.

> **Mlox** is a tool to analyze and sort your plugin order. However, you will be following the plugin order recommended by the guide, and thus we don't need to install it.

### tes3cmd

[**tes3cmd**](https://github.com/john-moonsugar/tes3cmd/releases/)  
tes3cmd is a tool used to clean plugins by automatically deleting identical-to-master records (records that are identical to the original records, but which may override intended changes by other mods) and to solve a number of conflicts/issues using a plugin, **multipatch.esp**. When needed, we will run it through Wrye Mash.
- Expand **Assets** under "v0.40-pre-release-2 (with trial Windows .exe)" and download **tes3cmd.exe**.
- Place tes3cmd.exe in **C:\Games\Morrowind\Data Files**.

> Unlike the other tools, tes3cmd doesn't need to be registered in Mod Organizer 2 as it is directly run from Wrye Mash (which we have already registered).

### Registering Wrye Mash in Mod Organizer 2

- Click the **Modify Executables** ![Executables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_Executables.png) button.
- Click the **Add an executable** ![AddExe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_Add_File.png) button and select *Add from file...*.
- Navigate to **C:\Games\Morrowind\Mopy** and double click **mash64.exe**.
- Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

> Unlike the other tools, it's not necessary to specify a **Start In** field for Wrye Mash.

# MODDING TIPS

### Don't uninstall mods mid-playthrough

A lot of things can go wrong when uninstalling a mod mid-playthrough. Some, expected. Some, completely unexpected.

### Always keep backup saves

Before you install a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.
Before you uninstall a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.

### Read the descriptions

Mod descriptions exist for a reason. The elaborate ones, for *good* reasons. Descriptions tend to list things such as:

- Requirements: mods or utilities a given mod needs to work as intended.
- Compatibility issues: known conflicts with other mods, whether general or specific.
- Known issues: bugs or unintended behavior.

Reading descriptions helps you troubleshoot mods, and what's more, decide beforehand whether a mod is worth the trouble of installing it.

### File structure matters

The file structure is how files are organized for the game to read these files and use them. Incorrect file structure accounts for a good deal of mods that don‚Äôt work properly.

### BSAs and Morrowind.ini

Some mods come with BSA files. These contain data files for the mod. The most popular mod which includes BSA files is the **Tamriel Rebuilt** project, which is not part of this guide. **BSA files** need to be **registered** in your Morrowind.ini file for the game to properly load the assets. Failing to do so results in a well known phenomenon of [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c).

> Morrowind# features no mods that use BSA files. If you ever install a mod that requires you to register BSA files, or otherwise modify your Morrowind.ini, remember to edit your .ini using Mod Organizer 2's Tools ![Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_ini.png) button.

# MOD ORGANIZER 2 TIPS

### Installing Nexus mods with Mod Organizer 2

Because Mod Organizer 2 is associated with Nexus links, mods downloaded in Nexus will be instantly added to Mod Organizer 2.

- Click **Mod manager download** under the file you want to download.
- Click **Slow download**.
- In Mod Organizer 2, click on the **Downloads** tab. You can check the download progress for your file there.
- Right-click the downloaded file, and click **Install**.
- MO2 will prompt you to give the mod a name. I suggest giving it a descriptive name, such as mod name + version number (e.g. "Patch for Purists 4.0.2").
- Click **OK**.
- The mod will appear in the left pane. Check the box next to it to finish installation.

> Whenever you are asked to install a mod from Nexus, limit yourself to the main file, unless explicitly told to install a different file. Likewise, if there are multiple main files present, you will be told which one you need to install.

### Manually installing mods with Mod Organizer 2

Sometimes authors will block the **Mod manager download** option in Nexus, and you will have to download the mod manually. In other occasions, you will download a mod from a different site altogether.

- Download your file.
- In Mod Organizer 2, click the **Install a new mod from archive** ![Archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_Archive.png) button.
- Navigate to the folder where the downloaded file is stored and double click on it.
- MO2 will prompt you to give the mod a name. I suggest giving it a descriptive name, e.g. "mod name" + "version number".
- Click **OK**.
- The mod will appear in the left pane. Check the box next to it to finish installation.

### Hiding files

Mod Organizer 2 lets you hide specific files from your installed mods, including anything from meshes to textures, but also plugins. This is a especially useful feature when you deactivate certain plugins from a mod but don't want to see them cluttering up your load order, or you want certain files not to overwrite another mod's.

- To hide a plugin, right click on your installed mod and click **Information...**.
- On the **Filetree** tab, right click on the plugins, folders, or files you want to hide, and click **Hide**.
- Mod Organizer 2 will hide the files, and these will no longer affect your game.

### Repackaging mods

There will be times you'll be greeted with the following message when installing a mod through Mod Organizer 2.

> **The content of data files does not look valid.**

In lieu of mod authors not fixing their mods themselves, there are two ways to fix this.

- Repackage the mod yourself and install it through Mod Organizer 2.
- Repackage the mod yourself *in* Mod Organizer 2.

The concept of a mod package is simple: if Mod Organizer 2 recognizes *anything* resembling a file structure (folders such as **Meshes** and **Textures**, or **.esp** and **.esm** files) the mod will be considered valid.

![DataFiles1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_FixingData1.png)

In this case, the mod contains a **Data Files** folder and a loose **.txt** file acting as the mod's documentation.

- Right-click on **Data Files**.
- Click **Set as data files directory**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, just do as I've shown above.

![DataFiles2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_FixingData2.png)

In this case, the mod contains loose files, and you will have to create a folder to drop them in.

Right-clicking on **data files** and clicking **Create directory...** will let you create a folder, and then it's just a matter of drag and dropping your files inside.

- Right-click on **data files**.
- Click **Create directory...**.
- Enter the name of the folder you want to create, and click **OK**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, I'll tell you which folders you have to create and what files do you have to move.

### Creating a separator

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. These can be created and then moved around in the left pane to place them where you want them to be.

- Right click on the empty space on the left pane, below **Overwrite**, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name your separator and click **OK**.

I suggest creating a separator for each of the following mod categories. Separators can be collapsed to keep your mod list clean and tidy, which you will come to appreciate when you install >100 mods.

### The Overwrite folder

The **Overwrite** folder is the destiny folder for the output of many of the tools we installed in **Setup**, e.g. distant Land generation will place its contents inside the **distantland** folder, configurable MWSE mods will place their files inside the **MWSE\config** folder. There's always a chance files in the **Overwrite** folder will overwrite assets and/or plugins from your installed mods.

## SYNCHRONIZING MOD MASTERS

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.
- Repeat this process for each of the faulty plugins.

> The case of Trackless Grazeland.ESP merits special attention. The mod will appear unticked, because it is missing a master file. However, following the steps mentioned above will remove the dependency on Texture Fix 2.0.esm, allowing you to play the mod without said mod installed.

## CLEANING OUR PLUGINS

> This section includes plugins from the extended guide.

**tes3cmd** lets us clean all active plugins in our load order, either individually or in mass. The latter process can take quite a while. For the purpose of this guide, we will only clean the plugins we know are dirty. For more information on how to clean plugins in mass, [**check the tes3cmd section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3cmd).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, right click on each of the following plugins and click **Clean with tes3cmd**. After the process is over, close the window.
  - Divayth Fyr Puzzle Fixed.ESP
  - Nordic Chest Replacer.ESP
  - TheMidnightOil.ESP

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**tes3cmd** also allows us to solve conflicts in leveled lists, generating a **multipatch.esp** file which will be placed at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds new weapons to a leveled list while another removes items from a leveled list (such as Daedric equipment).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, click the **Misc** header and go to **TES3cmd** -> **Create MultiPatch**. Click **Yes** on the prompt.
- tes3cmd will now generate the multipatch. After the process is over, click **OK**.
- **multipatch.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

**TES3Merge** lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in Mod Organizer 2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.ESP** will now be present at the end of your load order. Activate the plugin.

> The following instructions apply to followers of the extended guide.

**Merged Objects.ESP** makes a handful of unintended changes to the Imperial Netch Blade, Iron Spider Dagger, and Stormkiss records when using **BTBGI Necro Edit**. We will have to delete these unintended changes from our Merged Objects plugin.

- [**Run TESAME in Mod Organizer 2**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame).
- Delete the following records: 
  - Weapon **iron spider dagger**
  - Weapon **imperial netch blade**
  - Weapon **Stormkiss**
- This omits the unintended changes made by Merged Objects to these weapons.
</details>

## RE-RUNNING DISTANT LAND

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Use current load order**. This will select your active plugins for distant land generation.
- Click **Plugin directories...**
- Click **Add**. Select your **Morrowind\Data Files\Grass** folder.
- Seven grass plugins should have appeared in your load order. Check all of them.
  - [X] Rem_AC.esp
  - [X] Rem_AI.esp
  - [X] Rem_AL.esp
  - [X] Rem_BC.esp
  - [X] Rem_GL.esp (users of the extended guide should have Rem_GL_Trackless_GL.esp instead)
  - [X] Rem_Solstheim.esp
  - [X] Rem_WG.esp
- Click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

> Note that because Mod Organizer 2 uses a virtual file system, the Grass folder you will be selecting includes all plugins from Remiros' Groundcover as well as that from Grass for Trackless Grazeland, if following the extended guide.

## SHADER SETUP

We installed a number of shaders at the beginning of Morrowind#. If you've followed the extended guide, then there are a couple of mods that rely on additional shaders.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Graphics tab**, click **Enable shaders**.
- Click **Shader setup...**.
- On the **Set active shaders** window, click **Modding >>>**. Double clicking on the **Available shaders** makes them **Active shaders**, meaning the game will run them.
- Set your shader combination as follows.
```
SSAO HQ
Underwater Interior Effects
EdgeAA
deband_fogawarev2
Underwater Effects
Sunshafts
specialprocess
heathaze
r0_qk_shaker
```
- Click **Save** after setting up your shader chain.

## CLOSING COMMENTS

Broadly speaking, these are the steps you should follow whenever you install new mods. To summarize:

1. Get a reliable mod order and load order working.
2. Synchronize mod masters to avoid in-game warnings.
3. Clean dirty plugins.
4. Solve conflicts.
5. Re-run Distant Land.

## ADDITIONAL MCP PATCHES

> This section is exclusively for followers of the extended guide.
	
We installed the Morrowind Code Patch in the **Setup** page. However, certain mods installed in this guide require specific patches to work as intended.

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Hidden traps | Turns off the display of trap status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Hidden locks | Turns off the display of lock status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **BTB's Game Improvements** requires this patch for its weapon resistance changes to work as intended.

## IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

> This section includes mods from the extended guide.

The following mods need to be configured using the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

### abot's Smart Journal

- Set **Add a prefix in order to group quest names?** to 0. This will remove the lag when opening the quest page without this option set to 0.
- Disable every option below **Sort quests list by quest name?**. These options are useful to troubleshoot mods, but we don't need them. 

### abot's Tooltip

- Disable **Show item Value/Weight Ratio in tooltip**.

### Clock Block

- Set **Clock type** to Game time.

### Continue

- Enable **Hide Credits Button**.

### Controlled Consumption

- Set **Current consumption module** to Vanilla NPC Style (Necro Edit).

### Dynamic Timescale

Cell Settings
- Set **Wilderness timescale** to 60. This will slow down the timescale when in wilderness cells by 50%. In my opinion, the default value is way too high.

### Essential Indicators

General Settings
- Disable **Essential Item Indicator**.
- Disable **Essential NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver Faction Sensibility**.

Crosshair Settings
- Set **Crosshair Options** to ReverendKnots' Oblivion-Style. 

### Limited Leaping

- Set **Cooldown between jumps** to 1.
- Set **Minimum fatigue to jump** to 20. This matches the fatigue drain for jumping when using **BTB's Game Improvements**.

### N'wah Shooter

- Set **Hand shaking multiplier when archery** to 2.

### Putting Power in Willpower

- Enable **Allow negative Resist Bonus**.

### Quick Equip
- Set **Assign Keybind for Equipping Items** to Q.

### Security Enhanced

- Disable **Enable Probe Auto-Equip On Trapped Object Activation**.

> These instructions are exclusively for users of **Locks and Traps Detection**.

### Smarter Soultrap

- Set **Enforce skill requirements?** to On.

### Stealth Improved

- Disable **Experimental Enable light-based Stealth**.
- Disable **Show Light Bar**.

> This disables the somewhat buggy experimental light-based stealth.

### Tooltips Complete

- Disable **Show Key Tooltips**.
- Disable **Show Potion Tooltips**.
- Disable **Show Scroll Tooltips**.

> This disables the key tooltips which can be spoilery, as well as potion and scroll tooltips that may be rendered incorrect from the use of mods such as **BTB's Game Improvements**.

### UI Expansion

Please bear in mind that your game *may* crash when configuring this mod. That said, whatever changes you made will persist after launching the game again.

- Disable **Change map mode on cell change?**.
- (Optional) Set **Use verbose buttons instead of icons for inventory filtering?** to No.
- (Optional) Set **Use search bars?** to No.

# COMPATIBILITY

Morrowind# a big guide and touches on many aspects of the game. Though this guide is presented "as is", it doesn't mean you can't install other mods on top; only that you should think twice about what you are installing.

For reference, here is a list of known mods in the guide that tend to have compatibility issues with other mods.

- **Yet Another Guard Diversity**: this mod replaces vanilla guards with unique guards selected from leveled lists. But because of how this mod works, it is perfectly possible for a mod to override its changes (by moving the vanilla guards around) and have the guards revert to their vanilla, generic appearance. This would be most noticeable with Imperial Legion guards who don't wear closed helmets (unlike their Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, and Indoril counterparts). Moreover, new guards added to the game world will most likely have a generic appearance as well.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esps after Yet Another Guard Diversity.
- **Ownership Overhaul**: this mod touches on a *lot* of items in the game which are unowned, including doors, and it's not unusual at all for other mods (particularly big overhauls, like towns and cities) to override many of the changes made by this mod to a given location (e.g. a Pelagiad overhaul overriding the ownership of many items). Moreover, mods that add items to the game world may not account for ownership either, meaning those items are free for the taking.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esms and .esps after Ownership Overhaul.
- **Morrowind Anti-Cheese**, **BTB's Game Improvements - Necro Edit**: these mods make drastic changes to the game's balance, including the addition of new enemies to vanilla locations, stat tweaks to equipment and items, and edits to NPCs' inventories, stats, and spells. Any large overhaul that affects NPCs or vanilla items will quite possibly conflict with these mods (e.g. a faction overhaul, such as Vvardenfell Brotherhood or Morag Tong Polished). Depending on the conflict, it can be virtually harmless (without looking at TES3View you wouldn't even tell there is a conflict) or serious (an NPC that should have been buffed to a considerable degree reverts back to its vanilla, puny mook state).
  - Recommendation: use [**TES3View**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3view) to look at conflicts and determine the best course of action, whether that is modifying your load order, using TESAME to delete conflicting records, or create a patch using the Construction Set.
