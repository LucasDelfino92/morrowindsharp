# RUNNING BTBGI AND OTHER MODS WITH MORROWIND#

## DISCLAIMER

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in the Morrowind#. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Morrowind#.

At the request of many users, this document will guide you through the installation of BTBGI (Necro Edit), related mods, as well as equipment mods of high quality I have integrated into the game (either in their completion or by expanding on the original author's integration).

## BTBGI ADD-ON

[**Class-Conscious Character Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110)  
Attribute gains are no longer derived from level ups, but directly from skill increases; skill gains contribute to multiple attributes, to varying degrees depending on the skill; strong attributes increase faster than weak attributes; Luck automatically increases depending on the progression of your other attributes; skills and Endurnace contribute to determining your health; skills and Intelligence contribute to determining your magicka; Magicka regenerates over time, with the rate of regeneration determined by your initial and current skills in the magical arts and by your Willpower; each skill will start taking longer to increase once it reaches a certain threshold, which varies by skill. 

> Morrowind# recommends **MULE - Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience**. Make sure to uninstall that mod.

[**BTBGI (Necro Edit) Tweaked and Patches**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50308)  
Set of personal tweaks to [**BTB's Game Improvements - Necro Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47129), which makes significant changes to the game's birthsigns, races, spells, spell effects, alchemy ingredients, potions, equipment, enchantments, GMSTs, and faction requirements. 
- Rename the file to **BTBGI (Necro Edit) Tweaked and Patches** before installing it.
- BAIN options to install:
  - [X] 00 Core
  - [X] 01 Loot Patch + Weapons Integrated
  - [X] 02 Morrowind Anti-Cheese Tweaked
  - [X] 03 Ashfall Patch

> Morrowind# recommends **Morrowind Anti-Cheese**. This guide recommends the tweaked, BTBGI-compatible plugin instead. Make sure to uninstall the original mod.

> Morrowind# recommends **Restocking Alchemy Essentials**. However, BTBGI (Necro Edit) Tweaked already includes a similar functionality. Make sure to uninstall that mod.

## MOD CONFIG

A number of mods require additional in-game configuration.
	
[**MWSE Config 3.1.1**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13YJKjF0qc6Bvs-bg0qUDcJm8jtTxn1vd/view?usp=sharing)  
Includes **Mod Config** tweaks for the following mods, as well as additional edits not available through the in-game menu.
- BAIN options to install:
  - [X] 00 All in One: recommended option. Includes all configuration options, minus the last one.
  - [X] 08 Sneaky Strike: adjusts the critical strike damage range to play better with **BTB's Game Improvements**. Not included in **All in One**.

## ADDITIONAL MCP PATCHES

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **Enchanted Weapon Resistance** requires this patch for it to work.
