Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Hidden traps | Turns off the display of trap status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Hidden locks | Turns off the display of lock status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **Enchanted Weapon Resistance** requires this patch for it to work.
