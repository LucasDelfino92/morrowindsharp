- Right-click in the right pane of MO2 and select **Enable all**.
- Disable the plugins from **Remiros' Groundcover** (those starting with Rem_).

## Conflict Resolution

In this step we will use **TES3Merge** and **Wrye Mash** to solve conflicts in our load order, ensuring our installed mods work as intended.

### Running TES3Merge

- Run **TES3Merge** in MO2.
- The tool will generate a Merged Objects.esp, solving conflicts in your load order.
- Activate **Merged Objects.esp** at the end of your load order.

### Running Wrye Mash

- Run **mash64** in MO2.
- Click the **Misc** tab, then go to **TES3cmd** and **Create MultiPatch**.
- Click **Yes** to the prompt then **OK** once the process is finished.
- Exit Wrye Mash, and activate **multipatch.esp** at the end of your load order.

## Re-running Distant Land

In this step we will regenerate Distant Land (generated during the **Setup** section of the guide) to account for our newly installed mods. 

- Run **MGE XE** in MO2.

- Run **MWSE-Update.exe** from your game's **Root** folder.
- A command window will open and close shortly after, having updated MWSE to the latest version.

# Runnning Morrowind

REMINDER: Run the game using the **Morrowind** option in MO2.

![Executables](MO2/MO_Morrowind.png)

## In-game Configuration

- Click **Options**.
- Select the **Video** tab.
  - Set the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.
  - Set the **View Distance** slider all the way to the right, maximizing render distance for actors and other statics.
- Select the **Audio** tab.
  - Set the **Master** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Effects** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Footsteps** slider all the way to the left. Character Sound Overhaul's scripted footstep sounds will otherwise overlap with the vanilla footsteps.

> ⚠️ You should not adjust your resolution through the **Video** tab, as it will crash the game. Instead, run **MGE XE** and adjust it there.
