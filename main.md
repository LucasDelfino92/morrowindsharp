### Installation instructions:
- Download the file.
- Once it has finished downloading, click the folders button at the top of MO2 and select **Open Profile folder**.
- Extract the files from the downloaded archive to the folder you opened and overwrite when prompted.
- Once the file is extracted, click **F5** while you are on MO2 without any menu open.
- Right-click in the right pane of MO2 and select **Enable all**.
- Disable the plugins from **Remiros' Groundcover** (those starting with Rem_).

## Conflict Resolution

In this step we will use **TES3Merge** and **Wrye Mash** to solve conflicts in our load order, ensuring our installed mods work as intended.

### Running TES3Merge

- Run **TES3Merge** in Mod Organizer 2.
- The tool will generate a Merged Objects.esp, solving conflicts in your load order.
- Activate **Merged Objects.esp** at the end of your load order.

### Running Wrye Mash

- Run **mash64** in Mod Organizer 2.
- Click the **Misc** tab, then go to **TES3cmd** and **Create MultiPatch**.
- Click **Yes** to the prompt then **OK** once the process is finished.
- Exit Wrye Mash, and activate **multipatch.esp** at the end of your load order.

## Re-running Distant Land

In this step we will regenerate Distant Land (generated during the **Setup** section of the guide) to account for our newly installed mods. 

- Run **MGE XE** in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**. This will select all plugins for distant land generation, both active and unactive.
- Click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

## Shader Setup

> ⚠️ It is encouraged to skip this section unless your computer has more than 2GB VRAM, otherwise expect less than 30fps outdoors. At 8GB VRAM, I can hit a consistent 60fps even in the most performance intensive areas of the game.

In this step we will install additional shaders to **MGE XE** and configure our shader chain.

- Download [**MGE XE Shader Pack**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowindsharp/raw/main/mods/MGE%20XE%20Shader%20Pack.7z).
- Install the downloaded archive using manual install in Mod Organizer 2.
- You will be prompted with a **BAIN** installer, here select **Core** and click **Ok**.
- Run **MGE XE** in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Graphics tab**, click **Enable shaders**.
- Click **Shader setup...**.
- On the **Set active shaders** window, click **Modding >>>**. Set your **Active Shaders** as follows, by double clicking on the corresponding shader under **Available shaders**.
```
SSAO HQ
Underwater Interior Effects
EdgeAA
deband_fogawarev3
Underwater Effects
Sunshafts
Special Process
Eye Adaptation (HDR)
```
- Click **Save** after setting up your shader chain.

## Updating MWSE

Always remember to update MWSE when you install a new MWSE mod. Updates are pushed regularly, so there's a chance MWSE may have been updated since you first installed MGE XE in the **Setup** section.

- Run **MWSE-Update.exe** from your game's **Root** folder.
- A command window will open and close shortly after, having updated MWSE to the latest version.

> ℹ️ Make it a habit to update MWSE whenever you play Morrowind, and particularly when you download recent mods which rely on MWSE. These may have been developed with the latest update in mind.

# Runnning Morrowind

REMINDER: Run the game using the **Morrowind** option in MO2.

![Executables](MO2/MO_Morrowind.png)

## In-game Configuration

- Click **Options**.
- Select the **Video** tab.
  - Set the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.
  - Set the **View Distance** slider all the way to the right, maximizing render distance for actors and other statics.
- Select the **Audio** tab.
  - Set the **Master** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Effects** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Footsteps** slider all the way to the left. Character Sound Overhaul's scripted footstep sounds will otherwise overlap with the vanilla footsteps.

> ⚠️ You should not adjust your resolution through the **Video** tab, as it will crash the game. Instead, run **MGE XE** and adjust it there.

- Removed instruction to install the Project Atlas patch for Glow in the Dahrk, as it is outdated and causes missing features and a missing texture bug in MGE XE.

## September 25th, 2023

### Bug Fixes
- Removed Magican't because I don't think anyone ever notices the presence of the mod.

### User Interface
- Removed Oblivion Crosshair because it's up to preference.

## August 27th, 2023

### Gameplay
- Removed Poison Crafting because it's not a must-have mod even though the balance tweaks were nice.
