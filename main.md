## Updating MWSE

- Run **MWSE-Update.exe** from your game's **Root** folder.
- A command window will open and close shortly after, having updated MWSE to the latest version.

> ℹ️ Make it a habit to update MWSE whenever you play Morrowind, and particularly when you download recent mods which rely on MWSE. These may have been developed with the latest update in mind.

# Runnning Morrowind

REMINDER: Run the game using the **Morrowind** option in MO2.

![Executables](MO2/MO_Morrowind.png)

## In-game Configuration

- Click **Options**.
- Select the **Video** tab.
  - Set the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.
  - Set the **View Distance** slider all the way to the right, maximizing render distance for actors and other statics.
- Select the **Audio** tab.
  - Set the **Master** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Effects** slider all the way to the right. AURA's sound mixing was designed with this in mind.
  - Set the **Footsteps** slider all the way to the left. Character Sound Overhaul's scripted footstep sounds will otherwise overlap with the vanilla footsteps.

> ⚠️ You should not adjust your resolution through the **Video** tab, as it will crash the game. Instead, run **MGE XE** and adjust it there.
