# BEFORE WE BEGIN

## DISCLAIMER

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in the [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md#morrowind-setup) page. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Morrowind and the recommended tools.

## MODDING TIPS

### Don't uninstall mods mid-playthrough

A lot of things can go wrong when uninstalling a mod mid-playthrough. Some, expected. Some, completely unexpected.

### Always keep backup saves

Before you install a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.  
Before you uninstall a mod you are not completely sure about, make a backup of your save in case things go wrong.

### Read the descriptions

Mod descriptions exist for a reason. The elaborate ones, usually for a *good* reason. Apart from describing what a mod is supposed to, descriptions tend to list things such as:

- Requirements: mods or utilities a given mod needs to work as intended.
- Compatibility issues: known conflicts with other mods, whether general or specific.
- Known issues: bugs or unintended behavior.

Reading descriptions helps you troubleshoot mods, and what's more, decide beforehand whether a mod is worth the trouble of installing it.

### File structure matters

The file structure is how files are organized for the game to read and use them. Incorrect file structure accounts for a good deal of mods that donâ€™t work properly.

### BSA files

Some mods come with BSA files. These contain data files for the mod. The most popular mod which includes BSA files is the **Tamriel Rebuilt** project, which is not part of this guide. **BSA files** need to be **registered** in your Morrowind.ini file for the game to properly load the assets. Failing to do so results in a well known phenomenon of [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c).

To register a BSA file, launch Wrye Mash from Mod Organizer 2. In the **Mods** tab, click the **BSA Archives** tab to the right, and check the BSA you want to register.

> Note that Morrowind# features no mods that use BSA files.

## MOD ORGANIZER 2 TIPS

### Installing Nexus mods with Mod Organizer 2

Because Mod Organizer 2 is associated with Nexus links, mods downloaded in Nexus will be instantly added to Mod Organizer 2.

- Click **Mod manager download** under the file you want to download.
- Click **Slow download**.
- In Mod Organizer 2, click on the **Downloads** tab. You can check the download progress for your file there.
- Right-click the downloaded file, and click **Install**.
- MO2 will prompt you to give the mod a name. I suggest giving it a descriptive name, such as mod name + version number (e.g. "Patch for Purists 4.0.2").
- Click **OK**.
- The mod will appear in the left pane. Check the box next to it to finish installation.

> Whenever you are asked to install a mod from Nexus, limit yourself to the main file, unless explicitly told to install a different file. Likewise, if there are multiple main files present, you will be told which one you need to install.

### Installing multiple files from a same Nexus mod with Mod Organizer 2

There will be times when you will be asked to install multiple files from the same mod page. These can be either updates or optional files regarding a given mod, or multiple different mods from the same page, usually compilation pages for minor mods which the author didn't think deserved individual mod pages.

Mod Organizer 2 allows the user to either merge, replace, or rename the file being installed.

![ModExists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_ModExists.png)

What these options do is simple:

- **Merge** merges the contents of the file being installed with those of the file of the same name already installed. The new files will take priority over the old files, overwriting as necessary. This is useful when installing an update file which only includes certain files from the new mod.
- **Replace** replaces the contents of the already installed file with those of the newly installed file. This is akin to uninstalling the old file, and installing the new file. It is recommended you use this option whenever a mod has received a new update, as the update may not necessarily overwrite the old files.
- **Rename** installs the new file as a separate mod with a different name. In the case of compilation pages, this is a very useful feature as it lets you keep the different files (mods) as different installed mods.

> The guide will tell you when you need to merge, replace, or rename files in order to avoid problems.

### Manually installing mods with Mod Organizer 2

Sometimes authors will block the **Mod manager download** option in Nexus, and you will have to download the mod manually. On other occasions, you will download a mod from a different site altogether.

- Download your file.
- In Mod Organizer 2, click the **Install a new mod from archive** ![Archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_Archive.png) button.
- Navigate to the folder where the downloaded file is stored and double click on it.
- MO2 will prompt you to give the mod a name. I suggest giving it a descriptive name, e.g. "mod name" + "version number".
- Click **OK**.
- The mod will appear in the left pane. Check the box next to it to finish installation.

### BAIN installers

BAIN installers allow modders to split their mods into a number of options. This way, the user can select the options they want to install. 

This guide has numerous mods packaged as BAIN installers. Only the options you should install will be listed. If it is not listed, then you *must* skip that option.

### Hiding files

Mod Organizer 2 lets you hide specific files from your installed mods, like assets and plugins. A hidden plugin is treated as a deactivated plugin, with the bonus that it will no longer be listed in your load order. This is particularly useful when your load order is cluttered by deactivated plugins. Hiding assets is useful when you want certain files not to overwrite another mod's.

- To hide a plugin, right click on your installed mod and click **Information...**.
- On the **Filetree** tab, right click on the plugins, folders, or files you want to hide, and click **Hide**.
- Mod Organizer 2 will hide the files, and these will no longer affect your game.

### Repackaging mods

There will be times you'll be greeted with the following message when installing a mod through Mod Organizer 2.

> **The content of data files does not look valid.**

In lieu of mod authors not fixing their mods themselves, there are two ways to fix this.

- Repackage the mod yourself and install it through Mod Organizer 2.
- Repackage the mod yourself *in* Mod Organizer 2.

The concept of a mod package is simple: if Mod Organizer 2 recognizes *anything* resembling a file structure (folders such as **Meshes** and **Textures**, or **.esp** and **.esm** files) the mod will be considered valid.

![DataFiles1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_DataFiles.png)

In this case, the mod contains a **Data Files** folder and a loose **.txt** file acting as the mod's documentation.

- Right-click on **Data Files**.
- Click **Set as data files directory**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, just do as I've shown above.

![DataFiles2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO2_DataFiles2.png)

In this case, the mod contains loose files, and you will have to create a folder to drop them in.

Right-clicking on **data files** and clicking **Create directory...** will let you create a folder, and then it's just a matter of dragging and dropping your files inside.

- Right-click on **data files**.
- Click **Create directory...**.
- Enter the name of the folder you want to create, and click **OK**.
- The message will tell you the content of data files looks valid.

Whenever you encounter this scenario, I'll tell you which folders you have to create and what files you have to move.

### Creating a separator

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. These can be created and then moved around in the left pane to place them where you want them to be.

- Right click on the empty space on the left pane, below **Overwrite**, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name your separator and click **OK**.

I suggest creating a separator for each of the following mod categories. Separators can be collapsed to keep your mod list clean and tidy, which you will come to appreciate when you install over 100 mods.

### The Overwrite folder

The **Overwrite** folder is the destiny folder for the output of many of the tools we installed in **Setup**, e.g. distant Land generation will place its contents inside the **distantland** folder, configurable MWSE mods will place their files inside the **MWSE\config** folder. There's always a chance files in the **Overwrite** folder will overwrite assets and/or plugins from your installed mods.

  - [X] 04 Rain mesh replacer - regular
  - [X] 05 IT Vanilla sky texture replacer 2k
- Hide **textures\tw\Watch the Skies\blight\tew_blight_3.dds**
- Hide **textures\tw\Watch the Skies\foggy\tew_foggy_6.dds**

> This hides two very jarring sky textures.

[**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816)  
Regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
- Also install my [**Weather Adjuster Preset**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbQSqIMJrEHYak8yG0xAyTjyaiFwsggF/view?usp=sharing), which makes for darker nights and less horrible fog.
  - [**Comparison here.**](https://imgsli.com/MTUwMjI)

[**Subtle Magic Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/4468)  
Replaces the "plastic wrap" effect around in-game magic items (those equipped by characters or on the ground) with less-obtrusive versions.
- BAIN options to install:
  - [X] fade

[**Subtle Smoke**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47341)  
Makes it so many smoke effects are much more laid back and easier on the eyes.

[**Yet Another Guard Diversity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45894)  
Replaces the generic, copy-pasted guards of Morrowind with different variations. Some guards have different loadouts and armor, and each have different faces. Note that guards added by other mods will use the generic default guards.

> Note that guards added by mods will require a patch for unique guards.

[**Improved Thrown Weapon Projectiles**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44763)  
Mesh replacer for thrown weapon projectiles that makes them fly pointy end forward and, in some cases, spin in the air.
- Right-click on **Data Files**.
- Click **Set as data files directory** and click **OK**.

[**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069)  
Equipped weapons will be shown on the character's hip or back. This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.
- Also install [**Weapon Sheathing - Bow Position Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48473). Tweaks bows so that they line up better with the sheathing animation.
- Also install [**Weapon Sheathing Additions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49616). Adds sheaths to weapons not covered by Weapon Sheathing.

</details>

## SYNCHRONIZING MOD MASTERS

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.
- Repeat this process for each of the faulty plugins.

> The case of Trackless Grazeland.ESP merits special attention. The mod will appear unticked, because it is missing a master file. However, following the steps mentioned above will remove the dependency on Texture Fix 2.0.esm, allowing you to play the mod without said mod installed.

## MANUALLY CLEANING OUR PLUGINS

> This section includes plugins from the optional sections of the guide.

Some of our installed plugins contain changes we are not really interested in. These changes don't constitute dirty changes themselves, rather, changes we simply do not want. Because of this, we will be using [**TESAME**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame) to delete the unwanted records.

- Run TESAME in Mod Organizer 2.
- Delete the following record from **Services Restored.ESP**:
  - NPC **hecerinde**
- Save the plugin as **Services Restored.ESP**, overwriting the original.

> This omits the restoration of Hecerinde's Secret Master tools from [**Services Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068), for consistency with the rest of the Secret Master tools unavailable in the game.

- Run TESAME in Mod Organizer 2.
- Delete the following records from **Alex's Better Fitted Female Armors.ESP**:
  - Armor **netch_leather_cuirass**
  - Armor **imperial_chain_cuirass**
  - Armor **steel_cuirass**
  - Armor **imperial cuirass_armor**
- Save the plugin as **Alex's Better Fitted Female Armors.ESP**, overwriting the original.

> This removes the edits from [**Better Fitted Female Armors**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50187) to armor meshes which were already designed for female characters.

## AUTOMATICALLY CLEANING OUR PLUGINS

**tes3cmd** lets us clean all active plugins in our load order, either individually or in mass. The latter process can take quite a while. For the purpose of this guide, we will only clean the plugins we know are dirty. For more information on how to clean plugins in mass, [**check the tes3cmd section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3cmd).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, right click on each of the following plugins and click **Clean with tes3cmd**. After the process is over, close the window.
  - Divayth Fyr Puzzle Fixed.ESP
  - Nordic Chest Replacer.ESP
  - TheMidnightOil.ESP

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**tes3cmd** also allows us to solve conflicts in leveled lists, generating a **multipatch.esp** file which will be placed at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds new weapons to a leveled list while another removes items from a leveled list (such as Daedric equipment).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, click the **Misc** header and go to **TES3cmd** -> **Create MultiPatch**. Click **Yes** on the prompt.
- tes3cmd will now generate the multipatch. After the process is over, click **OK**.
- **multipatch.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

**TES3Merge** lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in Mod Organizer 2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.ESP** will now be present at the end of your load order. Activate the plugin.

## UPDATING AND REPAIRING SAVES

When uninstalling or modifying plugins in an on-going save, Morrowind will greet us with the following message on loading our save:
```
The currently selected master files and plugins do not match the ones used by this save game. 
Errors may occur during load or game play. Do you wish to continue?
```
To fix this, we have to synchronize our save's plugins to our current load order. In addition, we will also want to repair our save to fix any potential leftover issues from updating it. To do this, we will use **Wrye Mash**.

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Saves** tab, you will see a list with all your saves. Saves that do not need to be synchronized have a **purple box** next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty save, and a panel to the right will display the save's masters and plugins. Right click on any of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**.
- Should you have uninstalled plugins in an on-going save, an **Update Masters** window will appear telling you some masters were automatically deselected (as they are no longer present in your load order). Read the description on the box, as it tells you how to proceed if this isn't what you expected to happen. Otherwise, click **OK**.
- Once the window has closed, right click on the **Master** header above your save's masters and plugins, and click **Sync to Load List**.
- Click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.
- Right click on the save you just updated, and click on **Repair All**. Wrye Mash will repair your save file.
- You will get a message window with two possible outcomes: your save has been repaired by Wrye Mash, or Wrye Mash will tell you no problems where found. Close the window.

You do not need to repeat this process for each of your outdated saves, but just the ones you are planning to load.

## RE-RUNNING DISTANT LAND

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be rerun. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Use current load order**. This will select your active plugins for distant land generation.
- Click **Plugin directories...**
- Click **Add**. Select your **Morrowind\Data Files\Grass** folder.
- Seven grass plugins should have appeared in your load order. Check all of them.
  - [X] Rem_AC.esp
  - [X] Rem_AI.esp
  - [X] Rem_AL.esp
  - [X] Rem_BC.esp
  - [X] Rem_GL.esp (users of the optional sections of the guide should have Rem_GL_Trackless_GL.esp instead)
  - [X] Rem_Solstheim.esp
  - [X] Rem_WG.esp
- Click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

> Note that because Mod Organizer 2 uses a virtual file system, the Grass folder you will be selecting includes all plugins from Remiros' Groundcover as well as that from Grass for Trackless Grazeland, if following the optional Visuals section of the guide.

## SHADER SETUP

We installed a number of shaders at the beginning of Morrowind#. If you've followed the optional sections of the guide, then there are a couple of mods that install additional shaders.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Graphics tab**, click **Enable shaders**.
- Click **Shader setup...**.
- On the **Set active shaders** window, click **Modding >>>**. Double clicking on the **Available shaders** makes them **Active shaders**, meaning the game will run them.
- Set your shader combination as follows.
```
SSAO HQ
Underwater Interior Effects
Invisibility
EdgeAA
deband_fogawarev2
Underwater Effects
Sunshafts
Special Process
Eye Adaptation (HDR)
heathaze
r0_qk_shaker
```
- Click **Save** after setting up your shader chain.

> Note that all of these shaders, minus the ones added by mods and which thus won't work without them enabled, are optional. In particular, **Special Process** tends to be divisive.

## UPDATING MWSE

When you installed MGE XE, it automatically downloaded the latest MWSE update. However, by the time you are done following this guide, it's perfectly possible that a new MWSE update has already been released. This means you will have to update MWSE yourself.

- Run **MWSE-Update.exe** in **C:\Games\Morrowind**.
- A command window will open and close shortly after, having updated MWSE to the latest version.

Make it a habit to update MWSE whenever you play Morrowind, and particularly when you download recent mods which rely on MWSE. These may have been developed with the latest update in mind.

## MOD CONFIG

The following mods need to be configured using the in-game **Mod Config** menu.

## ADDITIONAL MCP PATCHES

> This section is exclusively for followers of the optional Overhauls section of the guide.
  
We installed the Morrowind Code Patch in the **Setup** page. However, certain mods installed in this guide require specific patches to work as intended.

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Hidden traps | Turns off the display of trap status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Hidden locks | Turns off the display of lock status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. Enable this option if you'd like **Class-Conscious Character Progression** to be more similar to **Galsiah's Character Development** (the mod CCCP is based on).

## CLOSING COMMENTS

Broadly speaking, these are the steps you should follow whenever you install new mods. To summarize:

1. Get a reliable mod order and load order working.
2. Synchronize mod masters to avoid in-game warnings.
3. Clean dirty plugins.
4. Solve conflicts.
5. Update and repair your saves.
6. Re-run Distant Land.
7. Update MWSE.
8. Configure the installed mods, if applicable.
