- Uncheck **Putting Power in Willpower - Absorbonach.ESP**

> This disables the gimmicky feature where Atronachs regenerate health from elemental attacks matching their element (they are immune to their own elements in the vanilla game either way).

- Open **MWSE\mods\HardTrade\main.lua** using a text editor.
- Comment out both **tes3.findGMST** lines and the **event.register("uiActivated", onPersuationMenu, {filter = "MenuPersuasion"})** line using "--", like so:
```
local function initialized(e)
--tes3.findGMST("fBargainOfferMulti").value = -10		tes3.findGMST("fSpellMakingValueMult").value = 10		tes3.findGMST("fEnchantmentValueMult").value = 100
--tes3.findGMST("fBribe10Mod").value = 20				tes3.findGMST("fBribe100Mod").value = 50				tes3.findGMST("fBribe1000Mod").value = 100

event.register("calcSpellPrice", onCalcPrice)
event.register("calcTravelPrice", onCalcPrice)
event.register("calcRepairPrice", onCalcPrice)

event.register("uiActivated", onBarterMenu, {filter = "MenuBarter"})
--event.register("uiActivated", onInventory, {filter = "MenuInventory"})
--event.register("menuEnter", onMenuEnter)
event.register("loaded", onLoaded)
end
event.register("initialized", initialized)
```
- Save your changes.

> By commenting out the two tes3.findGMST lines you will actually be commenting out *six* GMST edits, because of the way the code was written.

> This solves a compatibility issue with mods that alter these GMSTs (such as **BTB's Game Improvements**), and disables the Investing feature.

[**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299?tab=files)

# Finishing touches

## Additional Morrowind Code Patch patches

We installed the Morrowind Code Patch in the **Setup** page. However, certain mods installed in this guide require specific patches to work as intended.

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Class-Conscious Character Progression** and **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefit from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **BTB's Game Improvements** requires this patch for its weapon resistance changes to work as intended.

## Final mod order and load order

The mod order dictates the priority a given mod's assets have over the mods installed before it. Respect this order to ensure assets are overwritten as intended.

## Synchronizing mod masters

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.
- Repeat this process for each of the faulty plugins.

## Cleaning our plugins

**tes3cmd** lets us clean all active plugins in our load order, either individually or in mass. The latter process can take quite a while. For the purpose of this guide, we will only clean the plugins we know are dirty. For more information on how to clean plugins in mass, [**check the tes3cmd section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3cmd).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, right click on each of the following plugins and click **Clean with tes3cmd**. After the process is over, close the window.
  - Divayth Fyr Puzzle Fixed.ESP

## Conflict resolution

**tes3cmd** also allows us to solve conflicts in leveled lists, generating a **multipatch.esp** file which will be placed at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that adds new weapons to a leveled list while another removes items from a leveled list (such as Daedric equipment).

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, click the **Misc** header and go to **TES3cmd** -> **Create MultiPatch**. Click **Yes** on the prompt.
- tes3cmd will now generate the multipatch. After the process is over, click **OK**.
- **multipatch.esp** will now be present at the end of your load order.

**TES3Merge** lets us merge the objects in our active plugins in order to reduce conflicts, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will have to place at the end of our load order. This is very useful when, for example, you have a mod that modifies the stats on the Glass Armor while another modifies how it looks like: TES3Merge will merge both changes into a single plugin.

- Run TES3Merge in Mod Organizer 2. Once it's finished, press any key to exit.
- **Merged Objects.ESP** will now be present at the end of your load order. Activate the plugin.

**Merged Objects.ESP** makes a handful of unintended changes to the Imperial Netch Blade, Iron Spider Dagger, and Stormkiss records when using BTBGI Necro Edit. We will have to delete these unintended changes from our Merged Objects plugin.

- [**Run TESAME in Mod Organizer 2**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tesame).
- Delete the following records: 
  - Weapon **iron spider dagger**
  - Weapon **imperial netch blade**
  - Weapon **Stormkiss**
- This omits the unintended changes made by Merged Objects to these weapons.

## Re-running Distant Land

MGE XE's Distant Land setup should be re-run. If you followed the steps [**in this section**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#distant-land-tab) earlier, the process will be much easier.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Distant Land** tab, click **Distant land generator wizard**.
- Click **Select all**, and click **Continue**.
- Click **Run above steps using saved / default settings**.
- Click **Finish** when the process is over.

## Closing comments

Broadly speaking, these are the steps you should follow whenever you install new mods. To summarize:

1. Get a reliable mod order and load order working.
2. Synchronize mod masters to avoid in-game warnings.
3. Clean dirty plugins.
4. Solve conflicts.
5. Re-run Distant Land.

## In-game configuration

The following mods need to be configured using the in-game **Mod Configuration** menu.

### abot's Smart Journal

- Set **Add a prefix in order to group quest names?** to 0. This will remove the lag when opening the quest page without this option set to 0.
- Disable every option below **Sort quests list by quest name?**. These options are useful to troubleshoot mods, but we don't need them. 

### abot's Tooltip

- Disable **Show item Value/Weight Ratio in tooltip**.

### Clock Block

- Set **Clock type** to Game time.

### Continue

- Enable **Hide Credits Button**.

### Controlled Consumption

- Set **Current consumption module** to Vanilla NPC Style (Necro Edit).

### Dynamic Timescale

Cell Settings
- Set **Wilderness timescale** to 60. This will slow down the timescale when in wilderness cells by 50%. In my opinion, the default value is way too high.

### Essential Indicators

General Settings
- Disable **Essential Item Indicator**.
- Disable **Essential NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver NPC Indicator**.
- Disable **Quest-Giver Faction Sensibility**.

Crosshair Settings  
- Set **Crosshair Scale** to 80%.
- Set **Sneaking Crosshair Scale** to 80%.

### HardTrade

- Disable **Limit player stats to 100 when trading**.

### Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul

General and Cell Settings
- Set **Cell lighting value overrides** to NONE.
- If you've installed the **specialprocess** shader in **Setup**, set all three **Ambient color adjustments** to 75.

Light Settings  
- Disable **Use TLaD overrides for radius and color of light sources?**.

### Limited Leaping

- Set **Cooldown between jumps** to 1.
- Set **Minimum fatigue to jump** to 20. This matches the fatigue drain for jumping when using BTB's Game Improvements.

### Putting Power in Willpower

- Enable **Allow negative Resist Bonus**.

### Security Enhanced

- Disable **Enable Lockpick Auto-Equip On Locked Object Activation**.
- Disable **Enable Probe Auto-Equip On Trapped Object Activation**.

### UI Expansion

Please bear in mind that your game *may* crash when configuring this mod. That said, whatever changes you made will persist after launching the game again.

- Set **Auto-select search bar** to None.
- (Optional) Set **Use verbose buttons instead of icons for inventory filtering?** to No.
- (Optional) Set **Use search bars?** to No.

# Compatibility

Morrowind++ v2.x is a big guide and touches on many aspects of the game. Though this guide is presented "as is", it doesn't mean you can't install other mods on top; only that you should think twice about what you are installing.

For reference, here is a list of known mods in the guide that tend to have compatibility issues with other mods.

- **Ownership Overhaul**: this mod touches on a *lot* of items in the game which are unowned, including doors, and it's not unusual at all for other mods (particularly big overhauls, like towns and cities) to override many of the changes made by this mod to a given location (e.g. a Pelagiad overhaul overriding the ownership of many items). Moreover, mods that add items to the game world may not account for ownership either, meaning those items are free for the taking.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esms and .esps after Ownership Overhaul.
- **Yet Another Guard Diversity**: this mod replaces vanilla guards with unique guards selected from leveled lists. But because of how this mod works, it is perfectly possible for a mod to override its changes (by moving the vanilla guards around) and have the guards revert to their vanilla, generic appearance. This would be most noticeable with Imperial Legion guards who don't wear closed helmets (unlike their Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, and Indoril counterparts). Moreover, new guards added to the game world will most likely have a generic appearance as well.
  - Recommendation: just load conflicting .esps after Yet Another Guard Diversity.
- **Morrowind Anti-Cheese**, **BTB's Game Improvements - Necro Edit**: these mods make drastic changes to the game's balance, including the addition of new enemies to vanilla locations, stat tweaks to equipment and items, and edits to NPCs' inventories, stats, and spells. Any large overhaul that affects NPCs or vanilla items will quite possibly conflict with these mods (e.g. a faction overhaul, such as Vvardenfell Brotherhood or Morag Tong Polished). Depending on the conflict, it can be virtually harmless (without looking at TES3View you wouldn't even tell there is a conflict) or serious (an NPC that should have been buffed to a considerable degree reverts back to its vanilla, puny mook state).
  - Recommendation: use [**TES3View**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md#tes3view) to look at conflicts and determine the best course of action, whether that is modifying your load order, using TESAME to delete conflicting records, or create a patch using the Construction Set.
