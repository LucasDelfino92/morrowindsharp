- In line **725**, replace **tes3.effect.damageHealth** with **tes3.effect.damageMagicka**.

Adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla Detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors.

  - [X] 00 - Core

[**MM - Enhanced Invisibility**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565)  
Using invisibility changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Daedra and Undead appear differently, making them distinct from other creatures around you.

> ℹ️ The shader included in this mod needs to be registered in MGE XE to work as intended. Shader order will be given in the [**Shader setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/addon.md#shader-setup) section.

[**Map and Compass**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48455)  
Replaces the in-game world map with a realistic map, based on the paper maps that came with Morrowind and its expansions, and the in-game minimap with a compass.

> ℹ️ Because the minimap is no longer accessible with this mod installed, Detect spells will no longer have a use unless you use **MM - Enhanced Detection**, listed further ahead.

[**Map Replacements for Maps and Compass Wagner Style - Brujoloco Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48460)

[**Nerevarine Service Refusal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49528)  
Adds extra service refusal dialogue once you progress further into the main quest.

Levitation speed is now based on Willpower attribute instead of Speed.

> ℹ️ [**Link**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626) to original mod by **Sataniel**. The featured version includes fixes by **Necrolesian**.

## OVERHAULS

[**Class Skill Limit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989)  
Imposes configurable skill caps for major, minor and misc skills, making the class choice more important and motivating to stay faithful to it.

[**Class-Conscious Character Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110)  
Attribute gains are no longer derived from level ups, but directly from skill increases; skill gains contribute to multiple attributes, to varying degrees depending on the skill; strong attributes increase faster than weak attributes; Luck automatically increases depending on the progression of your other attributes; skills and Endurnace contribute to determining your health; skills and Intelligence contribute to determining your magicka; Magicka regenerates over time, with the rate of regeneration determined by your initial and current skills in the magical arts and by your Willpower; each skill will start taking longer to increase once it reaches a certain threshold, which varies by skill. 

> ℹ️ For a vanilla-friendlier alternative that also removes level up screens, see [**MULE - Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47452).

[**Locks and Traps Detection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48528)

Prevents the player from resting unless they activate a bed.

[**Nimble Armor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251)  
Makes armor contribute to player and NPCs' evasion modifier as well as allowing evading attacks to practice Unarmored and Light Armor skills. Optionally makes Unarmored fully focused on evading attacks.

[**Ownership Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48051)  
Assigns ownership to the many, many items and containers that rightly should be owned but weren't, and otherwise makes adjustments to item ownership.
- Hide **Ownership Overhaul.ESP**.

[**Reactive Resistance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48373)  
Creatures, NPCs and players alike affected by a disabling magic effect (like Paralyze) will gain a temporary immunity after a configurable period of time, preventing the spam of these effects for offensive purposes.

[**Realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673)  
Makes it so that repair hammers can only be used by activating an anvil, and prongs used by activating a forge. Optionally makes NPCs' equipped gear damaged to <20% condition when they die.
- Hide **Realistic_Repair_Optional.ESP**.

[**Realistic Repair Add-on**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47461)  
Adds new, immersive work stations throughout the world; search for new grindstones and workstations to repair and maintain your equipment.

> ℹ️ This mod is an improved and more extensive version of the plugin we hid earlier.

[**Silver Tongue**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharprepository/blob/main/Silver%20Tongue%20(Necro%20Edit).7z)  
Enhances Speechcraft via new gameplay mechanics and UI elements. Now an NPC's Disposition, Admiration, Intimidation, and Taunt will be locked behind skill gates. 

> ℹ️ [**Link**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086) to original mod by **VitruvianGuar**. The featured version includes fixes by **Necrolesian**.

[**Skills Module**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034)  
A lua-based framework that allows you to easily create new skills in Morrowind with just a few lines of code. This framework is a pre-requisite for **Ashfall**.

[**Ashfall - A Camping Survival and Needs Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057)  
A survival mod with hunger, thirst, tiredness, cooking, camping and temperature mechanics, as well as incredible new visuals, from seeing frost on your breath in cold weather, watching your food cook on the grill in real time, and seeing your camping gear displayed dynamically on your backpack.

> ℹ️ For detailed information on what this mod does and how to make use of its features, see its [**official wiki**](https://github.com/jhaakma/ashfall/wiki).

### Mod order and load order

[**Morrowind Sharp Modlist and Loadorder**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/Morrowind%20Sharp%20Modlist%20and%20Loadorder.7z)  
Adjusts mod order and load order for Morrowind Sharp to work as intended.
- Extract the files into **C:\Games\Morrowind Mods\MO2\profiles\Morrowind#**, overwriting when prompted.

> ℹ️ Mod order dictates the priority a given mod's assets have over the mods installed before it. This is handled by **modlist.txt**.
 
> ℹ️ Load order dictates the priority a given mod's plugins have over the mods' plugins loaded before them. This is handled by **loadorder.txt**.

### Synchronizing mod masters

Wrye Mash lets us synchronize the masters of mods we have installed. This will prevent certain error messages from popping up when launching the game.

- Run Wrye Mash (**mash64**) in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Mods** tab, you will see a list with all your plugins, both active and inactive. Plugins that do not need to have their masters synchronized have a green box next to them. Those that do need to have their masters synchronized will have a box of a different color.
- Click on the faulty plugin, and a panel to the right will display the plugin's masters. Right click on either of them, and an **Update Masters** window will appear. Click **Yes**. 
- Once the window has closed, click on the **Save** button further below the same panel.
- Repeat this process for each of the faulty plugins.

### Manually cleaning plugins

Some of our installed plugins contain changes we are not really interested in. These changes don't constitute dirty changes themselves, rather, changes we simply do not want. Because of this, we will be using [**TESAME**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/tools.md#tesame) to delete the unwanted records.

- Run TESAME in Mod Organizer 2.
- Delete the following record from **Services Restored.ESP**:
  - NPC **hecerinde**
- Save the plugin as **Services Restored.ESP**, overwriting the original.

> ℹ️ This omits the restoration of Hecerinde's Secret Master tools from [**Services Restored**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068), for consistency with the rest of the Secret Master tools unavailable in the game.

### Shader setup

We installed a number of shaders at the beginning of Morrowind#. If you've followed the optional sections of the guide, then there are a couple of mods that install additional shaders.

- Run MGE XE in Mod Organizer 2.
- In the **Graphics tab**, click **Enable shaders**.
- Click **Shader setup...**.
- On the **Set active shaders** window, click **Modding >>>**. Double clicking on the **Available shaders** makes them **Active shaders**, meaning the game will run them.
- Set your shader combination as follows.
```
SSAO HQ
Underwater Interior Effects
Invisibility
EdgeAA
deband_fogawarev2
Underwater Effects
Sunshafts
Special Process
Eye Adaptation (HDR)
```
- Click **Save** after setting up your shader chain.

> ℹ️ Note that all of these shaders, minus the ones added by mods and which thus won't work without them enabled, are optional. In particular, **Special Process** tends to be divisive.

### Additional MCP patches

We installed the Morrowind Code Patch in the **Setup** page. However, certain mods installed in this guide require specific patches to work as intended. Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Hidden traps | Turns off the display of trap status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
Game mechanics | Hidden locks | Turns off the display of lock status on object tooltips. **Locks and Traps Detection** requires this patch.
