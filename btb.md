The following mods should be disabled post mod order and load order adjustment:
- (Main) [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232)  
  Replaced in favor of Morrowind Anti-Cheese Tweaked.

### Conflict resolution

For record conflicts, we use **TES3Merge**, generating a **Merged Objects.esp** file which we will also place at the end of our load order.

- Run TES3Merge in Mod Organizer 2.
- The tool will generate a Merged Objects.esp, solving conflicts in your load order.
- Activate **Merged Objects.esp** at the end of your load order.
- Place **Beware the Sixth House BTBGI Patch** after **Merged Objects.esp**. This will ensure improper record merges are overwritten by the intended custom merge.

Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **Enchanted Weapon Resistance** requires this patch for it to work.
