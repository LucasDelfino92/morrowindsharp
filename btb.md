# BTBGI ADD-ON

## Disclaimer

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/main.md). Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Morrowind Sharp.

At the request of many users, this document will guide you through the installation of BTBGI (Necro Edit), related mods, as well as equipment mods of high quality I have integrated into the game (either in their completion or by expanding on the original author's integration).

## Preliminary steps

This guide recommends a number of mods in favor of others already installed in Morrowind Sharp. Thus, you should uninstall them.

These mods are:
- [**Area Effect Arrows Integrated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47745)
- [**Restocking Alchemy Essentials**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232)
- [**MULE - Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47452)
- [**Magicka Regeneration Suite**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49153)
- [**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232)

## CCCP AND BTBGI (Necro Edit)

[**Class-Conscious Character Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110)  
Attribute gains are no longer derived from level ups, but directly from skill increases; skill gains contribute to multiple attributes, to varying degrees depending on the skill; strong attributes increase faster than weak attributes; Luck automatically increases depending on the progression of your other attributes; skills and Endurnace contribute to determining your health; skills and Intelligence contribute to determining your magicka; Magicka regenerates over time, with the rate of regeneration determined by your initial and current skills in the magical arts and by your Willpower; each skill will start taking longer to increase once it reaches a certain threshold, which varies by skill. 

[**BTBGI (Necro Edit) Tweaked and Patches**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50308)

### Mod config

A number of mods require additional in-game configuration.
	
[**MWSE Config 3.1.2**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t5cAN0kQ9aa66ZAcL88vNAG1D-inl2Y9/view?usp=sharing)  
Includes **Mod Config** tweaks for the following mods, as well as additional edits not available through the in-game menu.
- BAIN options to install:
  - [X] 00 All in One: recommended option. Includes all configuration options, minus the last one.
  - [X] 08 Sneaky Strike: adjusts the critical strike damage range to play better with **BTB's Game Improvements**. Not included in **All in One**.

### Additional MCP patches

Note that the Morrowind Code Patch **remembers** your **previously installed options**, meaning you just need to look for the ones mentioned below and install them accordingly.

Category | Patch | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Game mechanics | Healthy appetite | Eating ingredients always succeeds, giving its first effect and skill advancement. **BTB's Game Improvements** removes the skill gain for consuming ingredients, and **Controlled Consumption** prevents you from spamming their consumption for overpowered effects.
Game mechanics | Attribute uncap | Allows levelling of the eight main attributes past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Game mechanics | Skill uncap | Allows levelling of player skills past 100. **Balanced Passive Races and Birthsigns** benefits from the use of this patch.
Mod specific | Weapon resistance change | Enchanted weapons no longer bypass the "normal weapon resistance" that many daedra possess. **Enchanted Weapon Resistance** requires this patch for it to work.
