## Description

Morrowind# is a modular modding guide for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, which aims to enhance Morrowind across the board. This guide is based on the following core pillars:

- Stability: following this guide, your game should rarely (if ever) crash.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all mods work as intended.
- Fidelity: mods suggested in this game should blend in seamlessly with vanilla Morrowind.

Morrowind# is divided in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#morrowind-setup), where I walk you through to getting the necessary patches, tools and utilities, as well as our mod manager running.
- [**Morrowind#**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw%23.md#morrowind), which is the bulk of the guide, and where we will be installing our mods proper. Many mods are recommended by default, while many others are listed under "optional" spoilers, and are intended for players wanting a more comprehensive installation. Even so, all mods present in this guide are entirely optional.

All information needed to follow these guides, like where mods are found, how to download them, what to look out for, and the appropriate mod order and load order, can be found in their respective pages.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods in this guide rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. This guide changes many aspects of the game which will be incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Though compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here, such as visual or gameplay improvements.

### Is this guide compatible with (mod)?

I can't say for sure. I can only give an opinion, but at the end of the day there's no substitute for reading the description of the mod and checking for compatibility in TES3View. Same goes for questions regarding mod order and load order. The less mods you install from the guide, the better the chances any mod you install will be compatible with it.

### How many plugins and mods are there?

I tried to keep the amount of recommended mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

There are roughly 90 recommended (a.k.a. "essential") mods, totalling 25 plugins. For people who love to mod their games, there are a total of 200 mods and 75 plugins.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 5.5GB, of which **Intelligent Textures** accounts for 65% the size of. And I *really* recommend you install Intelligent Textures.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how quick and thorough you are about it. I guarantee it will take you far less time than to set up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.
