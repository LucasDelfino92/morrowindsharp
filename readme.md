# MORROWIND S#ARP â€“ An Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Modlist

![Banner](pictures/banner.jpg)

## Important

As of June 2022, this modlist will no longer be updated. At the moment of writing this, **rfuzzo**'s [**Morrowind++**](https://r-fuzzo.gitbook.io/morrowind++/) guide covers many mods featured in Morrowind Sharp, and more.

Because his guide has a considerably different scope than the one presented here, Morrowind Sharp will remain on GitHub. I trust no pressing issues should be encountered by any using this guide.

## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed in the most immersive way possible.
- User interface: high resolution assets, improved functionality, and expanded hotkeys.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements brought over from modern TES titles.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.

This modlist is meant to address issues with the game, as well as perceived shortcomings. Because it is offered "as is", I won't be answering compatibility questions: the modlist is to be considered complete. For compatibility questions, the modlist includes instructions on the installation of **TES3View**.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 9GB. Morrowind Enhanced Textures accounts for most of that space, and it is entirely optional, even if thoroughly recommended.

### Is this modlist compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods require MWSE to work.

## Appendix

Morrowind Sharp isn't meant to be an exhaustive modlist. It attempts to cover the basics and go a little beyond that. For additional documents which tackle many mods not covered here, I suggest looking up **Lucevar**'s [**Themed Mod Lists**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods) (in particular, the [**SFX**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods/blob/master/sfx.md) article covers a lot of mods previously featured in my modlist) and **Danae**'s [**Modlists**](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/tag/modding/) (I would also suggest checking out [**her YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/terdanae) for cool Morrowind content).
