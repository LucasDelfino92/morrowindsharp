## Description

Morrowind++ is a modular modding guide for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, which aims to enhance Morrowind across the board. This guide is based on the following core pillars:

- Stability: following this guide, your game should rarely (if ever) crash.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all mods work as intended.
- Fidelity: mods suggested in this game should blend in seamlessly with vanilla Morrowind.

All mods present in Morrowind++ are 100% optional. However, you are encouraged to follow through with the guide until you are finished with the **Core** module, which contains all patches and fixes required to enjoy Morrowind to its fullest.

Morrowind++ is divided in three sections:

- [**Part 1**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#morrowind-part-1), where I walk you through to getting the game and our mod manager running, as well as the necessary patches and fixes to enjoy a stable and (nearly) bug-free experience. If you are new to Morrowind, you will definitely want to try out the game like this first.
- [**Part 2**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw++.md#morrowind-part-2), which contains all non-purist mods that expand on the vanilla game by addressing user interface, visuals, audio, and gameplay improvements. This section is intended for people who have already experienced Morrowind.
- [**Part 2.x**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw2.md#morrowind-part-2x), which is an extended version of **Part 2**, and includes even more mods, with a heavy emphasis on gameplay overhauls. This section is intended for very experienced Morrowind players, and should be used instead of **Part 2**.

All information needed to follow these guides, like where mods are found, how to download them, what to look out for, and the appropriate mod order and load order, can be found in these pages.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods in this guide rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. This guide changes many aspects of the game which will be incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Though compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here, such as visual or gameplay improvements.

### How many plugins and mods are there?

Morrowind++ consists of roughly 70 mods and 20 new plugins. I tried to keep the amount of mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

The extended Morrowind++ (**Part 2.x**) takes the number to roughly 160 mods and 60 new plugins.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 4.5GB, of which **Intelligent Textures** accounts for 75% the size of. And I *really* recommend you install Intelligent Textures.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how quick and thorough you are about it. I guarantee it will take you far less time than to set up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.
