## Description

Morrowind# is a modular modding guide for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, which aims to enhance Morrowind across the board. This guide is based on the following core pillars:

- Stability: following this guide, your game should rarely (if ever) crash.
- Compatibility: mod conflicts will be kept to a minimum in order to ensure all mods work as intended.
- Fidelity: mods suggested in this game should blend in seamlessly with vanilla Morrowind.

Morrowind# is divided in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md#morrowind-setup), where I walk you through to getting the necessary patches, tools and utilities, as well as our mod manager running.
- [**Morrowind#**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mw%23.md#morrowind), which is the bulk of the guide, and where we will be installing our mods proper. Many mods are recommended by default, while many others are listed under "optional" spoilers, and are intended for players wanting a more comprehensive installation. Even so, all mods present in this guide are entirely optional.

All information needed to follow these guides, like where mods are found, how to download them, what to look out for, and the appropriate mod order and load order, can be found in their respective pages.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods in this guide rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. This guide changes many aspects of the game which will be incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth. That said, many individual mods will be compatible. But I can't point these out for you.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Though compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt itself is very good, Tamriel Rebuilt content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods suggested here, such as visual or gameplay improvements.

### How many plugins and mods are there?

I tried to keep the amount of recommended mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

Depending on how far you wish to go, we are talking roughly 260 mods and 130 plugins, with the "recommended" mods being half the size of the total amount.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 5.5GB, of which **Intelligent Textures** accounts for 65% the size of. And I *really* recommend you install Intelligent Textures.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how quick and thorough you are about it. I guarantee it will take you far less time than to set up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.
