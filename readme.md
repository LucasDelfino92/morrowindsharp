# NEREVAR RISING â€“ An Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Modlist

![Banner](pictures/banner.jpg)

## About

**Nerevar Rising** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed in the most immersive way possible.
- User interface: high resolution assets, improved functionality, and expanded hotkeys.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements brought over from modern TES titles.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.

What this modlist doesn't do:

- Address every single micro-issue in the game: no game is perfect and all of them have flaws, yet we still enjoy them. My intention is to fix or at least address the most glaring ones, those that are a problem in the moment to moment experience.
- Add new features no one asked for: there are many gameplay mods out there, but the amount of them that actually try to fix issues with the existing game are in the minority.
- Nitpick over individual meshes or textures: unless it's an actual fix, this modlist won't bother. And even then, it probably won't bother either.
- Improve the meshes and textures of everything in the game: this alone can add another 50 or 100 mods to any install, and inconsistency will sooner than later rear its ugly head.

I've worked on this modlist for a few years already. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## Frequently asked questions

### How many plugins and mods are there?

There are 50 mods and 20 plugins total.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

The totality of the guide requires 9GB of installation space. However, Morrowind Enhanced Textures accounts for most of that space, and it is entirely optional, even if thoroughly recommended.

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods require MWSE to work.

### Is this guide compatible with...?

This modlist is offered as is, and I won't answer compatibility questions. If you want to find out if a mod is compatible, ask someone else, or use TES3View and Mod Organizer 2 to check for yourself and solve conflicts.
