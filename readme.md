## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements, new mechanics, and optional lightweight and ultra-compatible balance tweaks.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed and rebalanced.

Because this modlist is offered "as is" and to be considered complete, I won't be answering compatibility questions. Instructions on the installation and use of [**TES3View**](appendix.md#checking-for-conflicts) are provided. Use that tool to detect and solve conflicts.

Two versions of this modlist are available:
- The standard version, consisting of roughly 100 mods.
- The essentials version, consisting of roughly 30 mods.

## My setup

When installing this modlist, including the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 9GB. Morrowind Enhanced Textures and AURA accounts for most of the space, and are entirely optional (as all nearly all mods recommended).

### Is this modlist compatible with OpenMW?

Unfortunately many mods require MWSE to work, so the answer is "No".

## Suggested readings

Morrowind Sharp isn't meant to be an exhaustive modlist. It attempts to cover the basics and go a little beyond that. For additional documents which tackle many mods not covered here, I suggest looking up the following:

- **Lucevar**'s [**Themed Mod Lists**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods).
- **Danae**'s [**Modlists**](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/tag/modding/) (I would also suggest checking out [**her YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/terdanae) for cool Morrowind content).
- **rfuzzo**'s [**Morrowind++**](https://r-fuzzo.gitbook.io/morrowind++/) guide, which covers most mods featured in Morrowind Sharp, and much more, for a less purist experience.
