## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modding guide for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. Morrowind Sharp is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly guide focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. This means the guide avoids big gameplay and town overhauls, as well as the hundreds of texture and mesh replacers that make up the majority of most Morrowind modding guides.

I've worked on this guide for a few years already. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.

## Frequently asked questions

### How many plugins and mods are there?

There are 90 highly recommended mods, 30 plugins total. The complete guide has 190 mods, 70 plugins total.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

The totality of the guide requires 9GB of installation space. However, Morrowind Enhanced Textures accounts for most of that space, and it is entirely optional, even if thoroughly recommended.

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. No MWSE, no Morrowind Sharp.

### Is this mod compatible with Morrowind Sharp?

This modlist is offered as is, and I won't answer compatibility questions. If you want to find out if a mod is compatible, ask someone else, or use TES3View and Mod Organizer 2 to check for yourself and solve conflicts.

For a short break down:
- Tamriel Rebuilt: many of the mods featured in the guide are Vvardenfell-specific, meaning Tamriel Rebuilt will not benefit from them. But the guide should be 99% compatible.
- Morrowind Rebirth: no.
- Beautiful Cities of Morrowind: according to RandomPal, author of BCoM, it is. But refer to the disclaimer above.
