## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, with an emphasis on squashing the most noticeable bugs.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements, leaving the core experience intact. My opinion is that Morrowind is not to be enjoyed because of its gameplay, so the best thing we can do is to accept it for what it is.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed and rebalanced.

This modlist is meant to address issues with the game, as well as perceived shortcomings. Because it is offered "as is", I won't be answering compatibility questions: the modlist is to be considered complete. For compatibility questions, the modlist includes instructions on the installation of **TES3View**.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 6GB. Morrowind Enhanced Textures accounts for most of that space, and it is entirely optional, even if thoroughly recommended.

### Is this modlist compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods require MWSE to work.

## Appendix

Morrowind Sharp isn't meant to be an exhaustive modlist. It attempts to cover the basics and go a little beyond that. For additional documents which tackle many mods not covered here, I suggest looking up the following:

- **Lucevar**'s [**Themed Mod Lists**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods) (in particular, the [**SFX**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods/blob/master/sfx.md) article covers a lot of mods previously featured in my modlist).
- **Danae**'s [**Modlists**](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/tag/modding/) (I would also suggest checking out [**her YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/terdanae) for cool Morrowind content).
- **rfuzzo**'s [**Morrowind++**](https://r-fuzzo.gitbook.io/morrowind++/) guide, which covers most mods featured in Morrowind Sharp, and more.
