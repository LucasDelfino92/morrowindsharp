## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed and rebalanced.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements, new mechanics, and optional lightweight and ultra-compatible balance tweaks.

This modlist is offered "as is" and considered complete. I won't be answering compatibility questions. Instructions on the installation and use of [**TES3View**](appendix.md#tes3view) are provided. Use that tool to detect and solve conflicts.

Many of the instructions in this guide are taken verbatim from **VishVadeva**'s **The Midnight Ride** guide for Fallout 4, which explains in detail how to install mods using Mod Organizer 2. All credits go to him.

## Performance

When installing this modlist, including the recommended shaders, my framerate sits at a stable 60fps, even in the worst performing areas in the game (commonly known to be Vivec city and the Grazelands).

System | My Specs
------------ | -------------
OS | Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 5600
GPU | ASUS DUAL OC RX 6600 XT 8GB 
Monitor | Samsung 24" 1080p @ 60Hz
RAM | 16GB DDR4
SSD | Kingston KC3000 1TB

Roughly 9GB of space are required to install this modlist. Should you skip Morrowind Enhanced Textures and AURA, space needed will dramatically drop in size.
