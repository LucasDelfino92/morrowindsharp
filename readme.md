## DESCRIPTION

*Morrowind Improved* is the result of years of modding Morrowind: a modding guide that aims to enhance Morrowind across the board but without sacrificing its unique aesthetic. This mod list has been curated to keep the ever present mod conflicts to a minimum, ensuring you get the best out of each mod you may choose to install.

This mod list is divided in two major sections:

- The [Setup](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/setup.md) and [Mending Morrowind](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mendingmw.md) guides, which explain how to install the game, set up tools and mod manager, and patch Morrowind for a mostly bug-free, stable, and purist Morrowind experience.
- The [Modding Morrowind](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/moddingmw.md) and [Tools](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved/blob/master/mwtools.md) guides, which explain how to install many mods that enhance Morrowind, and how to solve potential issues with said mods.

While the Setup and Mending Morrowind are meant for everyone who is looking into playing Morrowind, the Modding Morrowind and Tools guides are aimed at more experienced modders. The **Modding Morrowind** guide, in particular, is divided into a series of modules, all of which can be installed independently from one another.

All mods present in Morrowind Improved will have a brief description on what they do, as well as the appropiate link to their mod pages (almost always on Nexus, rarely on Morrowind Modding History, and under very specific circumstances on my personal MediaFire).

At the end of both **Mending Morrowind** and **Modding Morrowind** you will find respective links to their mod and load order, allowing you to check whether you have installed the mods as intended.

## CONSIDERATIONS

There are a few things you may want to keep in mind before going through with this guide.

- This guide consists of 210 mods and a total 100 new plugins. You can always pick and choose what you'd like to install if this sounds too daunting to you.
- The total size of the guide is roughly 4GB of uncompressed files, 2GB of compressed mods you will have to download. But the truth is that **Mending Morrowind** compromises the major bulk, with 1.35GB of compressed mods.
- My mod manager of choice for Morrowind is **Mod Organizer 2**. The **Setup** module will explain in detail why I use it, and how to use it.
- This guide is not designed with **OpenMW** or **Morrowind Rebirth** in mind. This guide makes heavy use of the features of the Morrowind Script Extender, incompatible with OpenMW, and many of the mods present in this guide will conflict with the Morrowind Rebirth overhaul. You have been warned.
- This guide does not contemplate **Tamriel Rebuilt**, compatibility with the mod itself is very good. That said, Tamriel Rebuilt and its content will not benefit from the improvements made by many of the mods present in this guide.

## MY SETUP

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst) to 30fps (indoors). For reference, here is a my setup.
