## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modding guide for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. Morrowind Sharp is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly guide focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. This means the guide avoids big gameplay and town overhauls, as well as the hundreds of texture and mesh replacers that make up the majority of most Morrowind modding guides.

There are two ways to follow this guide:

- [**Wabbajack Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/wjsetup.md). The recommended way, automated and estimated to take no longer than 1 hour, of which most of the time will be spent leaving Wabbajack running and allowing it to download, extract, and install mods. Some manual tasks will be left up to the user, but they are in the minority. Includes the standard modlist as well as an abridged version, set up in different profiles for ease of selection.
- [**Manual Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md). The classic way, estimated to take around 4 to 5 hours. The first section (Setup) will list the installation of Morrowind, the setup of utilities and tools, with the second section devoted to the installation and configuration of mods.

I've worked on this guide for a few years already. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.

System | My Specs
------------ | -------------
Operative System | Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
CPU | Intel Core i5 4440
RAM | 8GB
Graphics | 1GB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series
HDD | 1TB
Monitor | Samsung 24" 1080p @ 60Hz

## Frequently asked questions

### How many plugins and mods are there?

I tried to keep the amount of recommended mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

There are roughly 180 mods and 55 plugins total.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

The totality of the guide requires 12.5GB installation space.

### How often is the guide updated?

Morrowind Sharp is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many modern mods (though not all) rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. I suggest following RandomPal's [**An Alternative to Morrowind Rebirth**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48812) guide instead.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Yes. That said, many of the mods featured in the guide are Vvardenfell-specific, meaning Tamriel Rebuilt will not benefit from them.

### Is (X) mod compatible with Morrowind Sharp?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in [**TES3View**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/tools.md#checking-for-conflicts). Instructions on how to use this tool are provided in this link.

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No. I'm always open to be given a game as a gift from my [**GOG Wishlist**](https://www.gog.com/u/Lucas9/wishlist), though. Argentina charges an extra 80% on purchasing foreign products, so you can imagine it adds up over time (if not discourages such purchases altogether).
