*Last updated: June 16th, 2023*.

## About

**Morrowind Sharp** is a modular modlist for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly high resolution upscaled textures, basic texture and mesh improvements, more immersive lighting.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed and rebalanced.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements, new mechanics, and optional lightweight and ultra-compatible balance tweaks.

This modlist is offered "as is" and considered complete. I won't be answering compatibility questions. Instructions on the installation and use of [**TES3View**](appendix.md#checking-for-conflicts) are provided. Use that tool to detect and solve conflicts.

## Performance

When installing this modlist, including the recommended shaders, my framerate sits at a stable 60fps, even in the worst performing areas in the game (commonly known to be Vivec city and the Grazelands).

## Frequently asked questions

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 9GB, of which Morrowind Enhanced Textures and AURA account for the majority of space needed.

### Is this modlist compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many mods require MWSE to work, which isn't supported by OpenMW.

## Suggested readings

Morrowind Sharp isn't meant to be an exhaustive modlist. It attempts to cover the basics and go a little beyond that. For additional documents which tackle many mods not covered here, I suggest looking up the following:

- **Lucevar**'s [**Themed Mod Lists**](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods).
- **Danae**'s [**Modlists**](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/tag/modding/) (I would also suggest checking out [**her YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/terdanae) for cool Morrowind content).
- **rfuzzo**'s [**Morrowind++**](https://r-fuzzo.gitbook.io/morrowind++/) guide, which covers most mods featured in Morrowind Sharp, and much more, for a less purist experience.
