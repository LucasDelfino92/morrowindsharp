## About

Morrowind# (pronounced *Sharp*) is a modular modding guide for **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**. Morrowind# is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly game focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. This means the guide avoids big gameplay and town overhauls, as well as the hundreds of texture and mesh replacers that make up the majority of most Morrowind modding guides.

This guide is split in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md). Includes setting up utilities and tools, as well as Mod Organizer 2. This section will be useful to anyone deciding to get into Morrowind, regardless of whether they want to install more mods on top or not.
- [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/main.md). Includes all mods we will be installing, including instructions for mod and load order, conflict resolution, configuration, and Distant Land generation. Mods are grouped by categories, and each category has an Optional section if you wish to install even more mods (however, the most important will have already been covered).

I've worked on this guide for a few years already. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 10fps (at worst, in the Grazelands) to 30fps (indoors), through 20fps outdoors. For reference, here is a my setup.

System | My Specs
------------ | -------------
Operative System | Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
CPU | Intel Core i5 4440
RAM | 8GB
Graphics | 1GB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series
HDD | 1TB
Monitor | Samsung 24" 1080p @ 60Hz

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with OpenMW?

No. Many modern mods (though not all) rely on the Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE), which is incompatible with OpenMW.

### Is this guide compatible with Morrowind Rebirth?

No. I suggest following RandomPal's [**An Alternative to Morrowind Rebirth**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48812) guide instead.

### Is this guide compatible with Tamriel Rebuilt?

Yes. That said, many of the mods featured in the guide are Vvardenfell-specific, meaning Tamriel Rebuilt will not benefit from them.

### Is this mod compatible with Morrowind#?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in [**TES3View**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/mwtools.md#checking-for-conflicts). For instructions on how to install this tool, check the [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/setup.md#tools) page.

### How many plugins and mods are there?

I tried to keep the amount of recommended mods relatively short and to the point. Most guides include a *huge* amount of graphic mods (retextures and mesh improvements), whereas I prefer to focus on specific graphical tweaks or visual effects that add to the game instead of changing what's already there.

There are roughly 90 recommended (a.k.a. "essential") mods and 30 plugins total. Including the Optional mods takes the count to roughly 210 mods and 70 plugins total.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 23GB, of which **Intelligent Textures**, **AURA**, and **TUBES4MUSE** account the majority of. However, only the former is strongly encouraged that you install if this is your first time playing Morrowind.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how thorough you are about it. I guarantee it will take you far less time than to set up most other Morrowind guides, bar the most spartan ones.

### How often is the guide updated?

Morrowind# is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is there a Wabbajack installer for the guide available?

No. I already have enough questions asked because users installed a mod without reading what it did. I don't want those questions to increase tenfold by providing an automated installer.

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No. I'm always open to be given a game as a gift from my [**GOG Wishlist**](https://www.gog.com/u/Lucas9/wishlist), though. We (Argentina) are charged an extra 80% (give or take) for purchasing foreign products, and it adds up over time.
