- [**Corprus Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45544) by grasscid: gives you the disease resisting effects of Corprus as soon as you catch it from Dagoth Gares rather than after Divayth Fyr cures you, as according to the lore.

- [**FMI - NotAllDunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569) by PoodleSandwich: not all Dunmer are slavers. Not all Argonians are slaves. Idle dialogue filtering has been improved to reflect this.

- [**King's Oath Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43284) by R-Zero: in-game dialogues and journal entries suggested that some exceptional members of Royal Guard wield King's Oath blades, but that wasn't the case.

- [**Telvanni Staff for the Telvanni Staff**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47869/) by Gavrilo93: according to in-game information, it seems that a Telvanni Mouth's symbol of office is the Silver Staff of Peace. Yet in vanilla, only you get one when you become a Mouth, which you would have to give to Fast Eddie when he becomes your Mouth. Therefore this mod adds a Silver Staff of Peace into the inventory of the six other Telvanni Mouths, including Baladas' Mouth, who only shows up mid-game.
- [**The Dream is the Door**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47423) by Melchior Dahrk: to align with what the in-game dialogue suggests, the entrance to the Cavern of the Incarnate will now only be visible during the magical hours of twilight. 
- [**The Madstone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47653) by Melchior Dahrk: makes the Madstone work as described on the lore, adds a new model to the Madstone, and expands on in-game dialogue.
- [**Thickle-Lo - The Succulent Hackle-Lo Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47502) by Melchior Dahrk: makes Hackle-lo leaves thicker as described in-game ("succulent").

- [**True Scourge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43294/) by R-Zero: makes the Scourge artifact behave more like its description in the game books. Now any summoned Daedra hit by this weapon gets instantly banished back to Oblivion.
  - Hide/disable **True_Scourge_zerosouls.esp**.
- [**What Thieves Guild**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47728) by Von Djangos: adds realistic individual cover "backgrounds" for thieves in the South Wall, The Rat in the Pot and Dirty Muriel's, additionally making the Thieves Guild harder to join as they won't simply advertise their services to you.
  - Note: I've been told that according to lore, the Thieves Guild has no reason to conceal their operations. However, if you find Thieves advertisting their guild awkward, then this mod is for you.
- [**Wizards Staff for Wizards**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48302) by Endify: gives a Wizards Staff to high ranking members of the Mages Guild, four in total.

Two versions are included, one with the original color of the Tamriel Rebuilt models, and another with a slightly more blue tint. No requirements.

  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:

This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.
  - Only install the **WeaponSheathing 1.6-MWSE** main file.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **Data Files** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.
- [**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816) by Hrnchamd: regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions.
  - This mod lets you adjust many variables about Morrowind's weather. Read the description to learn how to do this. The reason I recommend it (aside because of how great the mod is) is that users can share their presets: the mod on its own will not change the appearance of the game until you configure it so.
- [**Weather Adjuster - Morrowind Improved json**](http://www.mediafire.com/file/r7vlwhoko8rg2co/Weather_Adjuster_-_Sigourn%2527s_Mod_List_json.zip/file) by Sigourn: personal preset for darker nights and less horrible fog.
  - This mod has to be installed manually. Unpack the file and merge the **overwrite** folder with your Mod Organizer 2 **overwrite** folder, found inside the **Mod Organizer 2** folder. The contents of the folder should like so: **Mod Organizer 2\overwrite\MWSE\config\Weather Adjuster.json**.
  - [**Comparison here.**](https://imgsli.com/MTUwMjI)
- [**Well Diversified**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7fv2wojbp6y3uo9/AABIH_hMYjbqmZCPBnyu4NPqa?dl=0&preview=Well+Diversified.7z) by Slartibartfast: creates variants of the well mesh to better fit Imperial and Solstheim architecture.

### READABLE SIGNPOSTS

Choose between one of these two alternatives for readable signposts. My personal preference is PeterBitt's, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Atrayonis'.

- [**Near Vanilla Road Sign Replacer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44957?) by Atrayonis: makes road signs legible. Uses vanilla background and resolution.
  - MO2 will install this mod as a BAIN package. Tick the following options and click **OK**:
    - **00 Core**
    - **01 Vvardenfell only**
- [**Signposts Retextured**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42126?) by PeterBitt: makes road signs legible. Uses higher quality vanilla-friendly textures.
  - Install only one of the main files.

### LESS INTRUSIVE MAGIC GLOW

Choose between one of these two alternatives for less intrusive magic glow. My personal preference is Assetless No Glow, but if you are a vanilla purist nothing beats Subtle Magic Glow.

- [**Subtle Magic Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/4468?) by atteSmythe: replaces the "plastic wrap" effect around in-game magic items (those equipped by characters or on the ground) with less-obtrusive versions.
  - This mod is incorrectly packaged. Set **faint** as the proper **Data** directory in MO2.
- [**Assetless No Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47925/) by NullCascade: removes the "plastic wrap" effect around in-game magic items (those equipped by characters or on the ground). Uses less memory and is more compatible than other "no plastic wrap effect" mods.
  - For **Weapon Sheathing** to not add the glow effect back into sheathed equipment, we will need to comment some lines in **Weapon Sheating\MWSE\mods\weaponSheathing\main.lua**. We must add "-- " in front of these three lines, as seen here:
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, quiver.enchantment)
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, shield.enchantment)
    - -- tes3.worldController:applyEnchantEffect(visual, weapon.enchantment)
  - This will allow **Weapon Sheathing** to work flawlessly with **Assetless No Glow**.
  
### MGE XE MODS

### MWSEabotlib

The following mods by **abot** utilize a common **abot\lib.lua** file.

- [**Smart Map**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46634)
- [**Loading Doors Lock Tune**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46094)
- [**Smart Ammo**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47383?)

Older mods will have an older version of the file. Because of this, and in the interest of simplicity, if using any of the above mods in any capacity, you will also have to install the latest, most up-to-date **abot\lib.lua** file. This file will have to load after these four mods in order to overwrite their individual lib.lua file with the most up-to-date version.

- [**MWSEabotlib**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47717) by abot

### IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

**Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition** will require in-game configuration to work properly alongside **Immersive Mining**.

- During gameplay, open the main open and click **Mod Config**.
- The **Mod Configuration** menu will open and you will see a list of mods to the left. Click **Graphic Herbalism**.
- In the window that has opened, click the **Blacklist** tab.
- Our goal is to prevent **Graphic Herbalism** from working with ore veins. To do that, double click on every item under the **Objects** list that begins with the following prefixes:
  - **rock_adam_**
  - **rock_diamond_**
  - **rock_ebony_**
  - **rock_glass_**
- This will move said items under the **Blacklist** tab. Once you are finished, you can close the menus and play the game normally.

**Let There Be Darkness - Lua Lighting Overhaul** will require in-game configuration. I suggest the following settings.

- [**General and Cell Settings**](https://www.mediafire.com/view/kpl8be5scfc4odg/General_and_Cell_Settings.jpg/file)
- [**Light Settings**](https://www.mediafire.com/view/u6d5js3qdpx68rn/Light_Settings.jpg/file)
- The other two tabs will be automatically adjusted. Leave them be.

**Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod** will require in-game configuration to reduce the chances of earthquakes. I recommend opening up the console and typing **set fQuakeChance to 5** to reduce earthquake chance from 30% to 5%.

**Less Aggressive Creatures** will require in-game configuration. I suggest the following settings.

- **Peaceful Chance**: 50.
- **Blocked** list (creatures with a chance to spawn peaceful):
    - cliff racer
    - cliff racer_diseased
    - mudcrab
    - mudcrab_diseased
    - rat
    - rat_diseased
